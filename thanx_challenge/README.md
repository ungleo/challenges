# Challenge

At Thanx, we offer our merchants the ability to run a VIP engagement program
for their customers (users). In order for a user to become a VIP at a
merchant, a user needs to spend above the threshold set, for two consecutive
months.
For example if the threshold is $100, a user that spends $100 in January and
$100 in February, would become VIP. On the other hand, a user that spends
$100 in January and $85 in February, would not become VIP.
Given the below purchase data, write a program that takes a threshold and
purchase data as input and returns all users who would qualify for VIP in the
most recent month.
Optional: allow for a variable number of consecutive months as input.
Optional: add logic to generate sample purchase data

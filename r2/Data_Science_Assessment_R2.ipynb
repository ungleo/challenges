A mesh or matrix is formed by connecting one or more disks so that the number of disks in the rows equals the number of disks in the columns (it is always the case that the matrix will be squared). The thickness of each disc is fixed. For instance, if the matrix is defined to have nine disks (three rows and three columns), if the matrix is fully stretched (single row), its length will be nine times the diameter of each disk.\n","\n","The diameter $D$ and the volume of clay $V$ used have the following relationship:\n","\n","$ D(V,V_0)=   \\left\\{\n","\\begin{array}{ll}\n","      0.3\\sqrt{V-V_0}, & V>V_0 \\\\\n","      0, & V \\leq V_0 \\\\\n","\\end{array} \n","\\right. $\n","\n","where $V_0$ is the volume consumed in the firing process, in the same units as V. When $V \\leq V_0$, ceramic discs cannot be made.\n","\n","For example, consider $V_{total} = 12$, $V_0 = 1$. If the volume is used to make one disk, $V = V_{total} = 12$, $D = 0.9950$. If the clay is divided into a matrix of **two rows** (4 discs), the volume of each part is $V = V_{total}/4 = 3$ and the diameter of each new disc is $D'= 0.3 \\sqrt{3-1} = 0.4242$, therefore, the length of the array formed when stretched is 1.6971.\n","\n","**Problem description**\n","\n","Based on the example above, it can be noticed that the lengths of the matrices when stretched differ as the number of rows in the matrix changes. Develop an algorithm that calculates the number of rows in the matrix that must be made so that the matrix formed by stretching is as long as possible (the longest one, ideally), considering the input cases presented in the next section.\n","\n","**Input format**\n","\n","Each case that your solution will be evaluated against contains two numbers: $V_{total} (0 < V_{total} < 2^{64})$ and $V_0 (0 < V_0 < 2^{16})$, as defined above. The input ends with a case where $V_{total} = V_0 = 0$.\n","\n","**Output format**\n","\n","Each output line should express the number of rows of the disk matrix that must be made so that the matrix, when stretched, has the longest possible length. If this number is not unique, or if a disk array cannot be formed, the output must be 0. If the number exceeds $10^3$, the output must be operated with $mod(10^3)$ (modulo operation).\n","\n","**Input example\t$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$\tOutput example**\n","\n","12 1\t$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$\t\t\t2 \\\n","160 2\t$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$\t\t\t6 \\\n","0 0\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"id":"b6ff1fea","metadata":{"deletable":false,"id":"b6ff1fea"},"outputs":[],"source":["import datetime\n","\n","def big_numbers_output(no,number_limit=10**3):\n","    # If the number is bigger than the number_limit then the output is going to be the remainder of standard Euclidean division of the original number over the limit applied\n","    if no>number_limit:\n","        print ('big number, this is the remainder of standard Euclidean division of the original number over the limit applied')\n","        final_number = no % number_limit\n","        print('the original numer was: ',no, ' the output is: ', final_number)\n","        return final_number\n","    else:\n","        return no\n","\n","def get_max_row(ini_dict):\n","    # This function calculates the maximum value of the dictionary, if that max is duplicated then the answer is 0\n","    rev_dict = {}\n","    for key, value in ini_dict.items():\n","        rev_dict.setdefault(value, set()).add(key)\n","        \n","    result = [key for key, values in rev_dict.items()\n","                                if len(values) > 1]\n","    max_row = max(ini_dict, key=ini_dict.get)\n","    # now it checks if the max value is duplicated\n","    if ini_dict[max_row] in result:\n","        # the max value is duplicated\n","        print(\"duplicated values\", str(result), \" the answer is 0\")\n","        max_row = 0\n","        return max_row\n","    else:\n","        # no duplicated values\n","        max_row = big_numbers_output(max_row)\n","        return max_row\n","\n","def calculate_output(V,V0):\n","    ## -------------- TO DO -------------- ## \n","    print(str(datetime.datetime.now()) +': starting calculation' )\n","    dic_1 = {}\n","    r = 1\n","    v = V\n","    # while v is smaller than V0 it continues iterating\n","    while v>V0:\n","        # calculates v\n","        v = V / (r*r)\n","        # calculates the diameter\n","        d = 0.3*(v-V0)**0.5 \n","        # calculates the lenght\n","        l = d*r**2 \n","        # it adds the lenght to the dictionary if the number is a float \n","        if isinstance(l,float):\n","            dic_1[r] = l\n","        r = r + 1\n","    # if V<V0 no matrix is possible so the output is 0\n","    if V<V0:\n","        print('V < V0, no disc is possible')\n","        max_row = 0\n","    else:\n","        # it calls the get_max_row function that gets the row with the max but also checks if there is any duplicated value\n","        max_row = get_max_row(dic_1)\n","    print( 'max row : '+str(max_row))\n","    print(str(datetime.datetime.now()) +': calculation finished' )\n","    return max_row"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2c577efe","metadata":{"id":"2c577efe"},"source":["### Testing cells"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"f201695c","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"f201695c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["2022-08-29 08:44:13.433073: starting calculation\n","max row : 2\n","2022-08-29 08:44:13.434139: calculation finished\n","2022-08-29 08:44:13.434176: starting calculation\n","max row : 6\n","2022-08-29 08:44:13.434258: calculation finished\n","2022-08-29 08:44:13.434274: starting calculation\n","max row : 12\n","2022-08-29 08:44:13.434347: calculation finished\n","2022-08-29 08:44:13.434367: starting calculation\n","duplicated values [14.399999999999999]  the answer is 0\n","max row : 0\n","2022-08-29 08:44:13.434444: calculation finished\n"]}],"source":["# Testing the examples given\n","input_example = \"\"\"\n","12 1\n","160 2\n","1200 4\n","400 16\n","0 0\n","\"\"\"\n","output_expected = [2, 6,12,0]\n","\n","# Reading the input string\n","for idx,case in enumerate(input_example.split('\\n')[1:-1]):\n","    V, V0 = list(map(int, case.split(' ')))\n","    if V != 0 and V0 != 0:\n","        answer = calculate_output(V, V0)\n","        try:\n","            assert answer == output_expected[idx]\n","        except:\n","            print(\"Incorrect answer in case \" + str(idx+1) + \", the correct answer is \" + str(output_expected[idx]))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b2973cc1","metadata":{"id":"b2973cc1"},"source":["You will be tested with ten different cases such as the ones released in the input/output example description.

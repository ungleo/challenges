A mesh or matrix is formed by connecting one or more disks so that the number of disks in the rows equals the number of disks in the columns (it is always the case that the matrix will be squared). The thickness of each disc is fixed. For instance, if the matrix is defined to have nine disks (three rows and three columns), if the matrix is fully stretched (single row), its length will be nine times the diameter of each disk.\n","\n","The diameter $D$ and the volume of clay $V$ used have the following relationship:\n","\n","$ D(V,V_0)=   \\left\\{\n","\\begin{array}{ll}\n","      0.3\\sqrt{V-V_0}, & V>V_0 \\\\\n","      0, & V \\leq V_0 \\\\\n","\\end{array} \n","\\right. $\n","\n","where $V_0$ is the volume consumed in the firing process, in the same units as V. When $V \\leq V_0$, ceramic discs cannot be made.\n","\n","For example, consider $V_{total} = 12$, $V_0 = 1$. If the volume is used to make one disk, $V = V_{total} = 12$, $D = 0.9950$. If the clay is divided into a matrix of **two rows** (4 discs), the volume of each part is $V = V_{total}/4 = 3$ and the diameter of each new disc is $D'= 0.3 \\sqrt{3-1} = 0.4242$, therefore, the length of the array formed when stretched is 1.6971.\n","\n","**Problem description**\n","\n","Based on the example above, it can be noticed that the lengths of the matrices when stretched differ as the number of rows in the matrix changes. Develop an algorithm that calculates the number of rows in the matrix that must be made so that the matrix formed by stretching is as long as possible (the longest one, ideally), considering the input cases presented in the next section.\n","\n","**Input format**\n","\n","Each case that your solution will be evaluated against contains two numbers: $V_{total} (0 < V_{total} < 2^{64})$ and $V_0 (0 < V_0 < 2^{16})$, as defined above. The input ends with a case where $V_{total} = V_0 = 0$.\n","\n","**Output format**\n","\n","Each output line should express the number of rows of the disk matrix that must be made so that the matrix, when stretched, has the longest possible length. If this number is not unique, or if a disk array cannot be formed, the output must be 0. If the number exceeds $10^3$, the output must be operated with $mod(10^3)$ (modulo operation).\n","\n","**Input example\t$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$\tOutput example**\n","\n","12 1\t$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$\t\t\t2 \\\n","160 2\t$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$\t\t\t6 \\\n","0 0\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":40,"id":"b6ff1fea","metadata":{"deletable":false,"id":"b6ff1fea"},"outputs":[],"source":["def calculate_output(V, V0):\n","    ## -------------- TO DO -------------- ## \n","    raise NotImplementedError() # Remove this line when you type your solution"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2c577efe","metadata":{"id":"2c577efe"},"source":["### Testing cells"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":60,"id":"f201695c","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"f201695c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Incorrect answer in case 1, the correct answer is 2\n"]}],"source":["# Testing the examples given\n","input_example = \"\"\"\n","12 1\n","160 2\n","0 0\n","\"\"\"\n","output_expected = [2, 6]\n","\n","# Reading the input string\n","for idx,case in enumerate(input_example.split('\\n')[1:-1]):\n","    V, V0 = list(map(int, case.split(' ')))\n","    if V != 0 and V0 != 0:\n","        answer = calculate_output(V, V0)\n","        try:\n","            assert answer == output_expected[idx]\n","        except:\n","            print(\"Incorrect answer in case \" + str(idx+1) + \", the correct answer is \" + str(output_expected[idx]))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b2973cc1","metadata":{"id":"b2973cc1"},"source":["You will be tested with ten different cases such as the ones released in the input/output example description.
